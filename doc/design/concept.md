#Alcaeus

Alcaeus is named for an early Greek Poet/Musician who was outspoken
in his expression of love, democracy, and freedom.
He was exiled to an island for his criticisms of tyranny.

## What is Alcaeus

A resource for musicians wanting to collaborate with other musicians
to create music larger than themselves.

- They use their existing DAW recording/mixing software
(e.g. GarageBand, MixCraft, etc)
- They can call for others to help with their creation
- They can iterate with different takes and versions
- They can publish their completed works

### Who is who

There are different roles in this system

- User - one who is logged in and using the product.  Users must

  assume any of the following roles, permissions allowing.
- Public -- Any user can see published material and comment on it
- Producer -- A user who has a 'space' on the system and can manage
contributions and make releases.  The Producer is in charge of the
content during creation and the publication of the result.

to a work.  Producers control who has access to their projects.

 - Band -- a set of Producers that area allowed access to each other's
space as producers.
